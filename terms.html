Effort is made to instruct our staff on the severity of food allergies. Because of the number of meals served and the number of items used each day, along with food product changes from our food vendors, it cannot be guaranteed that every allergen in the food served will be identified. The possibility that manufacturers of the commercial foods we use could change the formulation at any time, without notice also exists. Customers concerned with food allergies must be aware of this risk. Hot Pot cannot assume any liability for adverse reactions to food consumed while eating at Hot Pot Takeaway.</p></div>
